DeepPavlov is an open-source conversational AI library built on [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/). It is designed for
 * development of production ready chat-bots and complex conversational systems,
 * NLP and dialog systems research.


### Breaking changes in version 0.2.0!
- `utils` module was moved from repository root in to `deeppavlov` module
- `ms_bot_framework_utils`,`server_utils`, `telegram utils` modules was renamed to `ms_bot_framework`, `server` and `telegram` correspondingly
- rename metric functions `exact_match` to `squad_v2_em` and  `squad_f1` to `squad_v2_f1`
- replace dashes in configs name with underscores

### Breaking changes in version 0.1.0!
- As of `version 0.1.0` all models, embeddings and other downloaded data for provided configurations are
 by default downloaded to the `.deeppavlov` directory in current user's home directory.
 This can be changed on per-model basis by modifying
 a `ROOT_PATH` [variable](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/latest/intro/config_description.html#variables)
 or related fields one by one in model's configuration file.
 
- In configuration files, for all components, dataset readers and iterators `"name"` and `"class"` fields are combined
into the `"class_name"` field.

- `deeppavlov.core.commands.infer.build_model_from_config()` was renamed to `build_model` and can be imported from the
 `deeppavlov` module directly.

- The way arguments are passed to metrics functions during training and evaluation was changed and
 [documented](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/latest/intro/config_description.html#metrics).

# Hello Bot in DeepPavlov

Import key components to build HelloBot. 
```python
from deeppavlov.skills.pattern_matching_skill import PatternMatchingSkill
from deeppavlov.agents.default_agent.default_agent import DefaultAgent 
from deeppavlov.agents.processors.highest_confidence_selector import HighestConfidenceSelector
```

Create skills as pre-defined responses for a user's input containing specific keywords or matching regexps. Every skill returns response and confidence.
```python
hello = PatternMatchingSkill(responses=['Hello world!'], patterns=["hi", "hello", "good day"])
bye = PatternMatchingSkill(['Goodbye world!', 'See you around'], patterns=["bye", "chao", "see you"])
fallback = PatternMatchingSkill(["I don't understand, sorry", 'I can say "Hello world!"'])
```

Agent executes skills and then takes response from the skill with the highest confidence.
```python
HelloBot = DefaultAgent([hello, bye, fallback], skills_selector=HighestConfidenceSelector())
```

Give the floor to the HelloBot!
```python
print(HelloBot(['Hello!', 'Boo...', 'Bye.']))
```

# Installation

0. Currently we support `Linux` and `Windows` platforms and `Python 3.6` 
    * **`Python 3.5` is not supported!**
    * **`Windows` platform requires `Git` for Windows (for example, [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)),  `Visual Studio 2015/2017` with `C++` build tools installed!**

1. Create a virtual environment with `Python 3.6`:
    ```
    virtualenv env
    ```
2. Activate the environment:
    * `Linux`
    ```
    source ./env/bin/activate
    ```
    * `Windows`
    ```
    .\env\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
3. Install the package inside this virtual environment:
    ```
    pip install deeppavlov
    ```

# Demo 

Demo of selected features is available at [demo.ipavlov.ai](https://demo.ipavlov.ai/)

# Quick start

To use our pre-trained models, you should first install their requirements:
```
python -m deeppavlov install <path_to_config>
```
  
Then download the models and data for them:
```
python -m deeppavlov download <path_to_config>
```
or you can use additional key `-d` to automatically download all required models and data with any command like `interact`, `riseapi`, etc.

Then you can interact with the models or train them with the following command:

```
python -m deeppavlov <mode> <path_to_config> [-d]
```

* `<mode>` can be `train`, `predict`, `interact`, `interactbot`, `interactmsbot` or `riseapi`
* `<path_to_config>` should be a path to an NLP pipeline json config (e.g. `deeppavlov/configs/ner/slotfill_dstc2.json`)
or a name without the `.json` extension of one of the config files [provided](deeppavlov/configs) in this repository (e.g. `slotfill_dstc2`)

For the `interactbot` mode you should specify Telegram bot token in `-t` parameter or in `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` environment variable.
Also you should use `--no-default-skill` optional flag if your component implements an interface of DeepPavlov [*Skill*](deeppavlov/core/skill/skill.py) to skip its wrapping with DeepPavlov [*DefaultStatelessSkill*](deeppavlov/skills/default_skill/default_skill.py).
If you want to get custom `/start` and `/help` Telegram messages for the running model you should:
* Add section to [*deeppavlov/utils/settings/models_info.json*](deeppavlov/utils/settings/models_info.json) with your custom Telegram messages
* In model config file specify `metadata.labels.telegram_utils` parameter with name which refers to the added section of [*deeppavlov/utils/settings/models_info.json*](deeppavlov/utils/settings/models_info.json)

You can also serve DeepPavlov models for:
* Microsoft Bot Framework ([see developer guide for the detailed instructions](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/latest/devguides/ms_bot_integration.html)) 
* Amazon Alexa ([see developer guide for the detailed instructions](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/latest/devguides/amazon_alexa.html)) 

For `riseapi` mode you should specify api settings (host, port, etc.) in [*deeppavlov/utils/settings/server_config.json*](deeppavlov/utils/settings/server_config.json) configuration file. If provided, values from *model_defaults* section override values for the same parameters from *common_defaults* section. Model names in *model_defaults* section should be similar to the class names of the models main component.
Here is [detailed info on the DeepPavlov REST API](http://docs.deeppavlov.ai/en/latest/devguides/rest_api.html)

All DeepPavlov settings files are stored in `deeppavlov/utils/settings` by default. You can get full path to it with `python -m deeppavlov.settings settings`. Also you can move it with with `python -m deeppavlov.settings settings -p <new/configs/dir/path>` (all your configuration settings will be preserved) or move it to default location with `python -m deeppavlov.settings settings -d` (all your configuration settings will be RESET to default ones).

For `predict` you can specify path to input file with `-f` or `--input-file` parameter, otherwise, data will be taken
from stdin.  
Every line of input text will be used as a pipeline input parameter, so one example will consist of as many lines,
as many input parameters your pipeline expects.  
You can also specify batch size with `-b` or `--batch-size` parameter.

# Docker images

We have built several DeepPavlov based Docker images, which include:
* DeepPavlov based Jupyter notebook Docker image;
* Docker images which serve some of our models and allow to access them via REST API (`riseapi` mode).
