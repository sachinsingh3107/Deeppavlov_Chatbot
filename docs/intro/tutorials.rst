`slides <https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov/tree/master/examples/tutorials/00_deeppavlov_intro.pdf>`__

Install the library and understand a simple "Hello World!" Bot written
in 7 lines of code. Experiment with basic pattern matching rule-based
bot.

Data preparation in DeepPavlov
------------------------------

Learn how to read and prepare data for trainable components.

Named Entity Recognition with DeepPavlov
----------------------------------------

`Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov/tree/master/examples/tutorials/02_deeppavlov_ner.ipynb>`__ \|
`slides <https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov/tree/master/examples/tutorials/02_deeppavlov_ner.pdf>`__ \|
`video <https://youtu.be/6HlL87PWxXU>`__

Build a simple convolutional neural network to solve the named entity
recognition task. Master data downloading, preprocessing and batching
then train and score the model.

Task-oriented bot with DeepPavlov
---------------------------------

Intro to DeepPavlov configs - a powerfull method to stack models. Study
how to train 4 different task-oriented bots on DSTC2 dataset. These
include (1) a basic bot, (2) a bot with a database of restaurants, (3) a
bot with fasttext embeddings, (4) a bot with attention mechanism over
input words.

Chit-chat bot with DeepPavlov
-----------------------------
