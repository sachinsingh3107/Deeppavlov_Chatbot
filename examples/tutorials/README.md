# DeepPavlov tutorials

## Introduction to DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](00_deeppavlov_intro.ipynb) | [slides](00_deeppavlov_intro.pdf) 

Install the library and understand a simple "Hello World!" Bot written in 7 lines of code. Experiment with basic pattern matching rule-based bot.

## Data preparation in DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](01_deeppavlov_data.ipynb)

Learn how to read and prepare data for trainable components.

## Named Entity Recognition with DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](02_deeppavlov_ner.ipynb) | [slides](02_deeppavlov_ner.pdf) | [video](https://youtu.be/6HlL87PWxXU)

Build a simple convolutional neural network to solve the named entity recognition task. Master data downloading, preprocessing and batching then train and score the model.  

## Task-oriented bot with DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](03_deeppavlov_gobot.ipynb) | [slides](03_deeppavlov_gobot.pdf) | [video](https://youtu.be/uvH1zB7qahI)

Intro to DeepPavlov configs - a powerfull method to stack models. Study how to train 4 different task-oriented bots on DSTC2 dataset. These include (1) a basic bot, (2) a bot with a database of restaurants, (3) a bot with fasttext embeddings, (4) a bot with attention mechanism over input words. 

## Chit-chat bot with DeepPavlov

[Jupyter notebook](04_deeppavlov_chitchat.ipynb) | [slides](04_deeppavlov_chitchat.pdf) | [video](https://youtu.be/G1TkCkoghC8)

Implement in DeepPavlov sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder model with attention mechanism and teacher forcing for chit-chat.
